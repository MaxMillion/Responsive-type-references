{"name":"Responsive Type References","body":"# Responsive Type References\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUpload the PHP or HTML file to your site, then visit it and choose your font selection using comma-separated values. If no fonts are given, it defaults to Georgia.\r\n\r\n    http://example.com/responsive-type.php?font=Georgia,Helvetica,Times New Roman\r\n    \r\n    http://example.com/responsive-type.html?font=Georgia,Helvetica,Times New Roman\r\n\r\n\r\n## Web Fonts\r\n    \r\nYou can also add in your Typekit ID if you want to include web fonts:\r\n\r\n    http://example.com/responsive-type.php?typekit=nqy2rqt&font=Georgia,Helvetica,chaparral-pro\r\n\r\nOr even add in your Google Web Fonts:\r\n\r\n    http://example.com/responsive-type.php?google=Prosto+One&font=Georgia,Helvetica,Prosto One\r\n    \r\nIf you really can't decide what font to use, you can even include both font libraries:\r\n\r\n\thttp://example.com/responsive-type.php?typekit=nqy2rqt&google=Prosto+One&font=Georgia,chaparral-pro,Prosto One\r\n\r\n\r\n## Font Availability\r\n\r\nSome fonts might look very similar, so how do you know if it's been included in your page? What happens if you've made a typo in the URL? I've added a script that detects what font is supposed to be there and compares it with the base font. This script is from [lalit.lab](http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect/), I did none of the hard work. \r\n\r\nIf the font is available, you get a green square next to the font name. If not, you get a red square. You might not want the overhead of javascript, so you can exclude it from the page using the 'js=no' parameter (PHP version).\r\n\r\n\thttp://example.com/responsive-type.php?font=Georgia,Helvetica&js=no\r\n\t\r\nThe font availability script works for the JavaScript version, but not for web fonts. I'll try and fix this is future releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## HTML / JavaScript Version\r\n\r\nThis version is in beta and still needs some testing and alteration, but use away and provide some feedback or modifications. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nForked from the original idea by [@Malarkey](http://twitter.com/Malarkey).
